The debian branch should be able to be synced directly with the
upstream master branch.  Once ready you can run the following to just
build the source package:

gbp buildpackage -S --git-tag

or the following to build the deb but prep the .changes for a
source-only upload:

gbp buildpackage --changes-option=-S --git-tag

Then upload with `dput`.
